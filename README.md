Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making it a critical area for predictive modeling in healthcare. The ability to accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics can significantly aid in early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict heart disease using a dataset with a variety of health-related features.

The dataset used for this project contains **250,000 rows** and **19 columns**, representing different health metrics such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and more. One key challenge is that only **15.8%** of the individuals in the dataset have heart disease, resulting in a **class imbalance** that could affect model performance, especially for metrics like recall and precision.

### **Objective**
The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models that predict heart disease in individuals based on the available features. We aim to investigate:
1. How well different feature sets (original features vs. engineered features) perform in predicting heart disease.
2. The impact of feature engineering and model evaluation techniques, such as SHAP values, on understanding feature importance.
3. The effect of class imbalance on model performance and how to mitigate it through techniques like feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

### **Key Challenges**
The project addresses several important challenges:
1. **Class Imbalance**: With only **15.8% of the dataset** representing heart disease cases, it is critical to ensure that the model performs well on both minority (positive) and majority (negative) classes. Metrics such as recall, precision, and ROC AUC are used to evaluate model performance.
2. **Feature Engineering**: We will explore the impact of combining and transforming original features to create engineered features that could improve the model's predictive power.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and ROC AUC. In addition, SHAP values will be used to interpret the model and identify the most important features driving predictions.

### **Approach**
1. **Data Preparation**: We start by cleaning the dataset and handling missing values, followed by splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries are used to understand the distribution of key features and the relationships between features and heart disease.
3. **Feature Engineering**: New features are created by combining important health metrics, which might reveal hidden relationships and interactions that improve model performance.
4. **Model Training and Tuning**:  XGBoost is trained on both original and engineered features. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
5. **Feature Importance with SHAP**: SHAP values are used to assess the contribution of each feature to the modelâ€™s predictions, providing interpretable insights into the importance of individual features.
6. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the model using various performance metrics, paying special attention to recall and precision due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

Through these steps, this project will demonstrate the complexities of predictive modeling for imbalanced healthcare data and highlight the importance of feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation techniques.
